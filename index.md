## About
![A picture of myself and my dog Kaito!](assets/images/me_when.jpg)

My name is Nicholas Nakano and I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego pursuing a major in Math-Computer Science and a minor in Music. I am also currently an intern with Cynthia.io, a AI and machine learning company. Outside of school and work, my hobbies include automotive racing, playing piano/guitar/saxophone, and drawing! よろしく！

My primary passion in programming lies in C++, especially in its applications to games and software! In addition, I also know C, C#, Java, JavaScript, SQL, and Python. As part of my work with Cynthia.io, I have recently been trying to learn TypeScript and Angular!
